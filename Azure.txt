Strategy- it is long term
Tactics - it is Short term steps taken to solve Non Functional Requirements



Azure Web App:
Azure Web App is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. Azure Web Apps is a part of Azure App Service and provides a platform to host web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends. Some key features:

   Automatic scaling and load balancing.

   Integration with databases and storage solutions.

   Support for multiple languages such as .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and more.




------------------Security Concerns in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
IaaS Security Risks:

IaaS exposes more of the infrastructure to users, which means managing the operating system, applications, and network security is the user's responsibility.

Common Attacks:

  Data breaches

  Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

  Vulnerabilities in virtual machine configurations

PaaS Security Risks:

In PaaS, security is shared between the cloud provider and the customer. While the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, the customer needs to focus on securing their application and data.

Common Attacks:

  Misconfiguration vulnerabilities

  Insufficient authentication and authorization

  API security risks

SaaS Security Risks:

SaaS models have the least amount of user control, as the application is fully managed by the provider. However, there are still potential security concerns related to user data and access management.

Common Attacks:

  Data leakage

  Account hijacking

  Service interruptions due to cyberattacks





Functional Requirements (FR):
Functional requirements specify what a system should do. They describe the specific behaviors, actions, or functions the system must have to meet the needs of its users. Essentially, functional requirements define the capabilities of the system.

    User Management: The system must allow administrators to create, edit, or delete user accounts.

    Data Retrieval: The system must be able to retrieve and display a list of products from the database.

Characteristics of Functional Requirements:
    Focus on specific actions or operations of the system.

    Can be expressed as user stories or use cases.

    Directly related to the system's core functionality.





Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):
Non-functional requirements specify how a system performs its functions. They define the quality attributes and operational aspects of the system, such as its performance, scalability, security, and availability. These requirements help ensure the system works effectively and meets the users' expectations in terms of system qualities.

Examples of Non-Functional Requirements:
    Performance: The system must handle 1000 concurrent users without degradation in speed.

    Scalability: The system must be able to scale horizontally to support a growing number of users.

    Availability: The system must have 99.9% uptime.

    Security: The system must encrypt sensitive user data using AES-256 encryption.

    Usability: The systemâ€™s user interface must be simple and intuitive for new users.

Characteristics of Non-Functional Requirements:
    Focus on system quality and performance.

    Often more general and can apply across multiple features or parts of the system.

    Can be measured or quantified (e.g., performance benchmarks, security standards).




Compile-Time Caching: This helps speed up the build process, particularly when dealing with large data or images.

Runtime Caching: Helps to reduce latency by storing frequently used data.




Alpine Linux is a security-focused, lightweight Linux distribution. Alpine is commonly used in Docker images because it is minimal, meaning it has a small footprint, which is ideal for containerized applications.

Benefits of Alpine Image:

   Small size (~5 MB).

   Minimal attack surface.
   
   Network




Kubernetes supports multiple scaling strategies for applications:

Horizontal Scaling (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling):

    Involves adding or removing instances (pods) of an application based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.

Vertical Scaling (Vertical Pod Autoscaling):

    Involves adjusting the resources (CPU, memory) allocated to a pod to meet demand.

Cluster Scaling:

    Involves adding or removing nodes (virtual machines) to the Kubernetes cluster based on the workload.




Bastion Host:
A Bastion Host is a server that acts as a gateway between a private network and the public internet. It is used to securely access servers in a private network (e.g., in a VNet). Bastion Hosts are configured with limited access and hardened security to minimize risk.




VNet (Azure): A VNet in Azure is a private network that allows communication between resources such as VMs, databases, and storage within the cloud.



Region: A geographical area containing multiple data centers. Azure regions are large geographic locations, and each region consists of multiple Availability Zones.

Availability Zones: These are physically separate locations within a region, designed to provide high availability by isolating failures and ensuring services continue running.

Zones: These refer to the individual fault-tolerant locations within a region.




Deployment Models:
   Deployment models describe how resources are distributed in the cloud:

   Public Cloud: Resources are shared across multiple organizations.

   Private Cloud: Resources are used exclusively by one organization.

   Hybrid Cloud: A mix of both private and public cloud resources.



Express Gateways:
    An Express Gateway in Azure connects on-premises networks to the Azure cloud via a dedicated private connection. ExpressRoute provides more reliability, speed, and security than traditional internet connections.



VNet/VPC Peering:
VNet/VPC Peering allows virtual networks to connect to each other and share resources. It is typically used when resources are distributed across multiple VNets.

Key Requirement: The IP address ranges of the peered VNets must be different to avoid conflicts.

Advantages of Peering:

    Cost-Effective: Without peering, transferring data between VNets requires using public IPs or VPNs, which can be costly.

    Security: Peering allows for private, secure connections between VNets.

    Reduced Latency: Communication within peered networks is faster since it avoids the public internet.




Azure Services: Creation and Scaling
Azure Subscription & Resource Groups: Subscriptions are containers for billing and resource management. Resource groups help organize and manage resources.

VM Scale Sets: Automatically scale VM instances based on demand. It integrates with Azure Load Balancer for distributing traffic across instances.

Availability Sets: Distributes VMs across fault domains, ensuring that at least one instance of a VM remains available in case of hardware failure.



to create networks we need cidr 
we have three 
32-42=8 ---> 2^8---> 255
10.0.0.0/24 ---> 10.0.0.0--- 10.0.0.255

network--        1    2    4     8     16     32     64    128      256
host--           256  128  64    32     16    8      4      2        1
subnet mask--    /24  /25  /26   /27   /28    /29   /30     /31      /32


we are dividing these into 4 ways: 10.0.0.0
TEAMS     ip range                      newtwork id              boardcast id                   cidr

A---  10.0.0.1---10.0.0.62               10.0.0.0                 10.0.0.63                   10.0.0.0/26      

B---  10.0.0.65---10.0.0.126             10.0.0.64                10.0.0.127                  10.0.0.64/26 

C---  10.0.0.129---10.0.0.190            10.0.0.128               10.0.0.191                  10.0.0.128/26 




In this setup, you're organizing a virtual network in Azure with proper subnetting and access control using Network Security Groups (NSGs).

1. Virtual Network (VNet):  
   - Acts like a container for your entire cloud network setup.  

2. Subnets:  
   - You divided the VNet into three logical parts (subnets):  
     - rohith-frontend: For frontend services (like web apps).  
     - rohith-backend: For backend services (like APIs, databases).  
     - rohith-private: For internal/secure systems (not publicly accessible).  

3. Virtual Machines (VMs):  
   - You created one VM inside each subnet with matching names. This keeps the setup clear and organized.

4. Network Security Groups (NSGs):  
   - By default, Azure assigns a security group â€” you **removed these defaults**.  
   - You created your own NSGs:
     - rohith-public: Used for both frontend and backend VMs â€” allows controlled public access.
     - rohith-private: Used for the private VM â€” restricts it to private/internal access only.


1. **Created a Virtual Network (VNet)**

2. **Subnets Created:**
   - `rohith-frontend`
   - `rohith-backend`
   - `rohith-private`

3. Virtual Machines Created:
   - One VM per subnet with the same name:
     - rohith-frontend VM
     - rohith-backend VM
     - rohith-private VM

4. Network Security Groups (NSGs):
   - Removed default NSGs from all VMs.
   - Created custom NSGs:
     - `rohith-public`: Assigned to `rohith-frontend` and `rohith-backend` subnets.
     - `rohith-private`: Assigned to `rohith-private` subnet.

After creating new NSGs add rules to the public and private NSGs, In public add the inbound rule and allow ssh with priotiy 150 and In private allow the backend ip address with 105 priority and then deny with priority with 110.
then we can access front to backend vm and then backend to private but we cannot access frontend to private.


24/04/2025:


Here we created new user account from the main account. how to create user account:
    click on entra id and click on add then click create newuser
    the enter then mail id and user name and the password 
    In assignment section add group named azuregroup and then create
After use can use the new user account and create virtual machine, etc..

Vnet peering:

here we need to create two vnet using commands:

     az network vnet create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <vnet_name> --address-prefixes <ad>

Then create two subnets:

     az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
  --vnet-name <vnet_name> \
  --name <subnet_name> \
  --address-prefix <subnet_prefix>

Then create VMs:
   az vm create \
 --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
 --name <vm_name> \
 --location <location> \
 --image <vm_image> \
 --vnet-name <vnet_name> \
 --subnet <subnet_name> \
 --admin-username <admin_username> \
 --admin-password <admin_password>

After creating vm allow icmp protocal for both vm1 and vm2 
then check using ping

Then create peering between two vnets using the command:

# Peering from VNet-2 to VNet-1
az network vnet peering create \
  --name peer-vnet2-to-vnet1 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet2 \
  --remote-vnet myVNet1 \
  --allow-vnet-access

# Peering from VNet-1 to VNet-2
az network vnet peering create \
  --name peer-vnet1-to-vnet2 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet1 \
  --remote-vnet myVNet2 \
  --allow-vnet-access


SSH into One of the VMs and the check the ping using another vm private ip address viceversa..




Then create new user account without adding group to it and create.
 
Then open main account and give the role in subscription like reader or contributor and check weather it is working in newly created user account when we give reader role it does not have any access to modify or delete. when you change it to contributor you can delete and modify.

Then create new useraccount and give the roles in resource group to new user account same vicevers..
